                Welcome to the prediction system through classification for your health,
                this system is used to predict in advance whether you have symptoms of
                diabetes, this application has carried out machine learning with a model
                from the KNN algorithm, namely calculating the closest distance which is
                very popular, namely euclidean distance. <br>You can see that this
                application with this model has the precision, recall, f1-score and
                accuracy values ​​below, so it can be said to be quite good for early
                predictions about health, especially diabetes.
